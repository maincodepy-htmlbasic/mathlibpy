# mathlibpy

## Version 0.0 (initial)

This is a python library for math and anything that is related to calculations.

This library would mainly be split up into two parts, that is, mathlibpy.num for numerical computations and mathlibpy.sym for symbolic computations

mathlibpy.num will contain numpy and math while mathlibpy.sym will contain mainly sympy

There will be more in coming soon.

## Version 0.1

Now added sym and vec for symbolic and vector computation respectively

Now, \_\_init\_\_.py has all the commands so `from mathlibpy import *` is now possible.

vec.py is made up mainly of the new class, Vector

And one more thing, a new unit.py will be added in __Version 0.2__.
